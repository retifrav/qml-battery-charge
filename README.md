# QML battery charge

QtQuick/QML demonstration - an application that shows a charging battery. No connection to the real battery on your device - just a simulation using animations, particles and other whistles and bells.

99% of the code is taken from [QUIt Coding](http://quitcoding.com/?page=work#quitbattery), so read the original [README](/README.original.md) too.

I am not sure if the original `Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported` license is compatible with `GPLv3`, but I would like to license this repository exactly under `GPLv3` (because it's Qt).

I also borrowed the application icon from [here](http://www.iconarchive.com/show/vista-hardware-devices-icons-by-icons-land/Battery-Power-Full-icon.html).
